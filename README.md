# Employee Tracker

## Purpose

I built this database backend to track the employees, salaries, roles, and departments of a company

## Description and Usage

This database contains multiple tables for the employees, their roles, and their departments. Upon launching the program, the user is presented with a list of options on what they would like to do. They are able to view the current database tables, or add objects to those tables, all through the terminal. When done, they can simply exit the program.
